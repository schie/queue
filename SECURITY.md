# Security Policy

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues**.

## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from public
disclosure of security vulnerabilities without a fix available. We achieve
that by following the process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a
private manner, and are only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period
of the patch being available for users.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the
project, or any of the project’s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

We consider the security of the project a top priority.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following
means of communications to report it to us:

- Open a private report via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/schie/queue/security/advisories/new).

We sincerely appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings
with us.
